In fact, the situation is getting worse. The apartment and floor I was shown is not the apartment I thought I was renting but was given one in a completely different location in much worse condition. I have seen no progress in said improvements and when I voice my complaints the only response is &amp;quot;We love you here and want more residents like you. We are getting rid of the old residents blah blah blah .&amp;quot; I have spoken to some of the residents who have lived here for years and their reason for moving out is deteriorating circumstances and poor management, not that they were bad residents as management depicts. In fact, some of the new residents are responsible for cited problems. Environment Some residents/guests are extremely trashy and leave litter, spilled drinks, and food EVERYWHERE inside and outside the building. The residents/guests break stuff or do not respect property. The parking garage gates break on a regular basis which led to a car theft and several break-ins just two weeks ago. The front entrance guest box does not work so you must come downstairs to let anyone in the building, that is, if the front doors lock properly. The elevators break on an almost weekly basis. Homeless people raid the garbage and take baths in the pool. Overnight security disappeared in the last few weeks before the cars were broken into and still no overnight or weekend security has been provided. The carpet and hallways are in bad condition and smell horrible. My floor always smells like meth, curry, and trash. The only response from management is that they are not responsible for anything, and the lease mentions this a million times. Dog owners Dog owners are not responsible. I have had my neighbor&amp;apos;s dog pee and poop in front of my door several times. There is dog poop scattered all around the premises, sidewalks, and the park at the end of the property. This mostly comes from big dogs so it is a very foul smelling and accumulates quickly. The doggy bags the property has provided are large sized trash bags which the homeless use and discard along the nearby nature trail. There are pit bulls on premises. The owner breeds them and told me in a conversation that they are aggressive. I have caught him two times with his dogs off the leash inside and outside the building. Delivery/Parking/Trash Valet My first three weeks here I had 4 packages stolen or that went missing. The other reviews about this subject are correct. The response from management is that they are working on the situation. Again, no progress seen. The parking garage is extremely trashy and dirty with all sorts of residues that get trafficked into the building. There are abandoned cars and then there are those residents who do not respect parking regulations. There are residents who park in front of the building all the time and never get towed as management has proclaimed it would happen. Trash Valet does not collect on the weekends and the hours they do collect vary widely each day. Some residents always leave their garbage cans outside in the corridor which is against lease terms. Other I have never received a walkthrough checklist. Management has no record of vehicles of residents. There are storage closets which management wants to charge an exuberant extra fee for on top of overpriced rent. I am still waiting 5 weeks and several follow-ups for them to tell me which units are available. Management can&amp;apos;t even spell the name of the road correctly on their notices. There are also BBQ grills which are still visible even after a notice was sent to residents which is a direct violation of fire code. The streetlights on eon&amp;apos;s side have not worked for weeks. I do hope things get better, but this is the current situation here. Take heed and make informed decisions.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","reviewAspect":"","ratingValue":1.8}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"anonymous"},"datePublished":"2022-6-21","name":"","reviewBody":"The worst community in the area, the new management sucks, high turnovers can&amp;rsquo;t keep good staff, the concierge acts more as management trying to assist with prolonged issues with out the knowledge, while the management stands back overseeing and buying furniture instead of fixing real issues, says a lot about her priorities and experience.

However, these problems have been stemming since 2017, so clearly there is no real care to make this a desirable place for their residents. In addition, take a look in the elevators next time you&amp;apos;re visiting, and you&amp;apos;ll see the monetary incentive to write good reviews. I&amp;apos;ve been here since then, and have let my optimism get the better of me, particularly when announcements were made last year to change leadership. I think this was an attempt to shift blame, because it has actually gotten worse. The appeal of Marta and access to shops/ bars is a blinding attraction to this complex. One of the worst decisions I&amp;apos;ve made. This entire place is incompetent from the ground up. The valet garbage does not work, or they haven&amp;apos;t been paid by eon, yet residents are lining the hallways with garbage. Watch your step for glass throughout the garage, as there have been multiple car break-ins, in a &amp;quot;GATED&amp;quot; garage. Most days you don&amp;apos;t need your fob to get in, as the magnetic lock doesn&amp;apos;t work to get into the elevator lobby from the garage. In addition, while there are two elevators, only one has been in operation since late 2020, so I&amp;apos;d plan for an extra 10-15 minutes door-to-car. The water bill has avg over $250 since March of 2021, and eon has refused to deal with the problem. Their solution is transferring my calls until, hopefully, I tire out and give up. I&amp;apos;ve talked with the City of Atlanta, and they said it&amp;apos;s a complex issue, not a water pumping issue. The front office is a joke. There were two people on staff, one was entirely enthralled with her Facebook feed, while the other was resolving a dispute with her friends from the evening before. All clearly more pressing matters than those of the residents waiting patiently in the lobby to have their problems dealt with. Should you order a package, and wish to pick it up, you&amp;apos;d have to make time to queue up in a 2hr time slot, during the middle of the day, with all the other residents who&amp;apos;re also finally able to receive what they purchased. I&amp;apos;ve started sending all of my Amazon packages to the pick-up hub near GT, because at least there I am assured I can get my stuff during their business hours. I&amp;apos;m excited to move to another complex in Buckhead/ Lindbergh. The area is great, but not every place there is. I&amp;apos;ve terminated my lease early, fully knowing that the remainder would have to be paid out. No matter. Anything to get out of here. If you take a tour, PLEASE see more than just the model unit, and use this review as a guide for a different perspective than those trying to lease you the unit.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","reviewAspect":"","ratingValue":1.5}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Verified Resident 917285"},"datePublished":"2021-6-15","name":"","reviewBody":"Overall My experience has been good so far I&apos;m looking forward to seeing what more this property has to offer.

been living here for two months now and I feel as if the management has misrepresented the property and the plans the new owner has. In fact, the situation is getting worse. The apartment and floor I was shown is not the apartment I thought I was renting but was given one in a completely different location in much worse condition. I have seen no progress in said improvements and when I voice my complaints the only response is &quot;We love you here and want more residents like you. We are getting rid of the old residents blah blah blah .&quot; I have spoken to some of the residents who have lived here for years and their reason for moving out is deteriorating circumstances and poor management, not that they were bad residents as management depicts. In fact, some of the new residents are responsible for cited problems. Environment Some residents/guests are extremely trashy and leave litter, spilled drinks, and food EVERYWHERE inside and outside the building. The residents/guests break stuff or do not respect property. The parking garage gates break on a regular basis which led to a car theft and several break-ins just two weeks ago. The front entrance guest box does not work so you must come downstairs to let anyone in the building, that is, if the front doors lock properly. The elevators break on an almost weekly basis. Homeless people raid the garbage and take baths in the pool. Overnight security disappeared in the last few weeks before the cars were broken into and still no overnight or weekend security has been provided. The carpet and hallways are in bad condition and smell horrible. My floor always smells like meth, curry, and trash. The only response from management is that they are not responsible for anything, and the lease mentions this a million times. Dog owners Dog owners are not responsible. I have had my neighbor&#x27;s dog pee and poop in front of my door several times. There is dog poop scattered all around the premises, sidewalks, and the park at the end of the property. This mostly comes from big dogs so it is a very foul smelling and accumulates quickly. The doggy bags the property has provided are large sized trash bags which the homeless use and discard along the nearby nature trail. There are pit bulls on premises. The owner breeds them and told me in a conversation that they are aggressive. I have caught him two times with his dogs off the leash inside and outside the building. Delivery/Parking/Trash Valet My first three weeks here I had 4 packages stolen or that went missing. The other reviews about this subject are correct. The response from management is that they are working on the situation. Again, no progress seen. The parking garage is extremely trashy and dirty with all sorts of residues that get trafficked into the building. There are abandoned cars and then there are those residents who do not respect parking regulations. There are residents who park in front of the building all the time and never get towed as management has proclaimed it would happen. Trash Valet does not collect on the weekends and the hours they do collect vary widely each day. Some residents always leave their garbage cans outside in the corridor which is against lease terms. Other I have never received a walkthrough checklist. Management has no record of vehicles of residents. There are storage closets which management wants to charge an exuberant extra fee for on top of overpriced rent. I am still waiting 5 weeks and several follow-ups for them to tell me which units are available. Management can&#x27;t even spell the name of the road correctly on their notices. There are also BBQ grills which are still visible even after a notice was sent to residents which is a direct violation of fire code. The streetlights on eon&#x27;s side have not worked for weeks.

Has the main entrance looking like the place to be meanwhile… This place is horrible roaches, cars stolen, cars broken into, apartments being broken into, with no memo’s to inform residents, lack of communication to residents complaints and safety, smells in hallways, never been cleaned carpet in hallways with years of noticeable trash waste stains, unsafe and unsecured garages, nasty pool residue, the grounds are horrible, the apartments are nice but have roaches and nets that has been living there probably since 2018 because they are not going away. Not to mention the one Spanish lady they use to clean the whole building (imagine that) the weekends are even worse no cleaning, no structure what so ever. So it’s super nasty nasty from Friday until Monday! Don’t invite guests because you’ll be embarrassed! You’ll pay for pest control, trash, concierge, and a few more things with your rent and it isn’t worth your hard earned money. Roaches will still be thr your car may be stolen or broken into and to feel unsafe coming home is a major concern. You will be very disappointed with your stay/lease.

However, these problems have been stemming since 2017, so clearly there is no real care to make this a desirable place for their residents. In addition, take a look in the elevators next time you&#x27;re visiting, and you&#x27;ll see the monetary incentive to write good reviews. I&#x27;ve been here since then, and have let my optimism get the better of me, particularly when announcements were made last year to change leadership. I think this was an attempt to shift blame, because it has actually gotten worse. The appeal of Marta and access to shops/ bars is a blinding attraction to this complex. One of the worst decisions I&#x27;ve made. This entire place is incompetent from the ground up. The valet garbage does not work, or they haven&#x27;t been paid by eon, yet residents are lining the hallways with garbage. Watch your step for glass throughout the garage, as there have been multiple car break-ins, in a &quot;GATED&quot; garage. Most days you don&#x27;t need your fob to get in, as the magnetic lock doesn&#x27;t work to get into the elevator lobby from the garage. In addition, while there are two elevators, only one has been in operation since late 2020, so I&#x27;d plan for an extra 10-15 minutes door-to-car. The water bill has avg over $250 since March of 2021, and eon has refused to deal with the problem. Their solution is transferring my calls until, hopefully, I tire out and give up. I&#x27;ve talked with the City of Atlanta, and they said it&#x27;s a complex issue, not a water pumping issue. The front office is a joke. There were two people on staff, one was entirely enthralled with her Facebook feed, while the other was resolving a dispute with her friends from the evening before. All clearly more pressing matters than those of the residents waiting patiently in the lobby to have their problems dealt with. Should you order a package, and wish to pick it up, you&#x27;d have to make time to queue up in a 2hr time slot, during the middle of the day, with all the other residents who&#x27;re also finally able to receive what they purchased. I&#x27;ve started sending all of my Amazon packages to the pick-up hub near GT, because at least there I am assured I can get my stuff during their business hours. I&#x27;m excited to move to another complex in Buckhead/ Lindbergh. The area is great, but not every place there is. I&#x27;ve terminated my lease early, fully knowing that the remainder would have to be paid out. No matter. Anything to get out of here. If you take a tour, PLEASE see more than just the model unit, and use this review as a guide for a different perspective than those trying to lease you the unit.</p><ul class="Styles__Photos-et3kwc-6 ehKRDa"></ul><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 iLNgiL"><ul class="Styles__Actions-et3kwc-11 ekyrxG"><li><button id="112951845" class="Styles__HelpfulButton-txng2v-1 jcRAwE helpful"><span class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 cYriwS" color="#656565" wrap="false"><span class="Styles__IconContainer-txng2v-7 hQUOWA"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#656565" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></span> <!-- -->Helpful <!-- -->(1)</span></button></li><li><button id="112951845-report" class="Styles__ReportButton-txng2v-2 hOequf report"><span class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 cYriwS" color="#656565" wrap="false"><span class="Styles__IconContainer-txng2v-7 hQUOWA"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#656565" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M4 15s1-1 4-1 5 2 8 2 4-1 4-1V3s-1 1-4 1-5-2-8-2-4 1-4 1z"></path><line x1="4" y1="22" x2="4" y2="15"></line></svg></span> <!-- -->Report</span></button></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 lciwsT"><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 iLNgiL"><div class="Styles__ResponseContainer-o4bm14-0 hTzfLD"><div display="flex" class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 kYZsIp"><div class="Styles__Author-o4bm14-3 jRkOYz"><span class="Styles__AuthorName-o4bm14-4 huXjnn">Manager</span></div><p class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 komrsf" color="#3D3D3D" display="inline" wrap="false">6/23/2021</p></div><div class="Styles__Title-o4bm14-1 ivjSPl">ibex at Uptown</div><div class="Styles__ResponseText-o4bm14-2 cdwpyQ">We are sorry to hear that you are no longer a resident with us, Nick.

Now the only reason why you should consider this apartment complex is if you need to be close to your work. 

The apartment needs to be taken care of as a newborn baby or things start falling apart. Good luck with maintenance as it may take up to months before your issue is resolved. Trash bags and the smell of weed are always present in the corridor to greet you. Elevators have a mind of their own and decide when they want to work and when they just want to chill. Occasionally you may find dog piss/poo in the elevator or stairs.</p><ul class="Styles__Photos-et3kwc-6 ehKRDa"></ul><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 iLNgiL"><ul class="Styles__Actions-et3kwc-11 ekyrxG"><li><button id="112920234" class="Styles__HelpfulButton-txng2v-1 jcRAwE helpful"><span class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 cYriwS" color="#656565" wrap="false"><span class="Styles__IconContainer-txng2v-7 hQUOWA"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#656565" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></span> <!-- -->Helpful </span></button></li><li><button id="112920234-report" class="Styles__ReportButton-txng2v-2 hOequf report"><span class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 cYriwS" color="#656565" wrap="false"><span class="Styles__IconContainer-txng2v-7 hQUOWA"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#656565" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M4 15s1-1 4-1 5 2 8 2 4-1 4-1V3s-1 1-4 1-5-2-8-2-4 1-4 1z"></path><line x1="4" y1="22" x2="4" y2="15"></line></svg></span> <!-- -->Report</span></button></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 lciwsT"><div class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 iLNgiL"><div class="Styles__ResponseContainer-o4bm14-0 hTzfLD"><div display="flex" class="Box-sc-18o4p67-0 kYZsIp"><div class="Styles__Author-o4bm14-3 jRkOYz"><span class="Styles__AuthorName-o4bm14-4 huXjnn">Manager</span></div><p class="Styles__StyledText-nixkvj-0 komrsf" color="#3D3D3D" display="inline" wrap="false">5/11/2021</p></div><div class="Styles__Title-o4bm14-1 ivjSPl">ibex at Uptown</div><div class="Styles__ResponseText-o4bm14-2 cdwpyQ">Thank you for your honest review of our community.

have been living here for two months now and I feel as if the management has misrepresented the property and the plans the new owner has. In fact, the situation is getting worse. The apartment and floor I was shown is not the apartment I thought I was renting but was given one in a completely different location in much worse condition. I have seen no progress in said improvements and when I voice my complaints the only response is \u0026quot;We love you here and want more residents like you. We are getting rid of the old residents blah blah blah .\u0026quot; I have spoken to some of the residents who have lived here for years and their reason for moving out is deteriorating circumstances and poor management, not that they were bad residents as management depicts. In fact, some of the new residents are responsible for cited problems. Environment Some residents/guests are extremely trashy and leave litter, spilled drinks, and food EVERYWHERE inside and outside the building. The residents/guests break stuff or do not respect property. The parking garage gates break on a regular basis which led to a car theft and several break-ins just two weeks ago. The front entrance guest box does not work so you must come downstairs to let anyone in the building, that is, if the front doors lock properly. The elevators break on an almost weekly basis. Homeless people raid the garbage and take baths in the pool. Overnight security disappeared in the last few weeks before the cars were broken into and still no overnight or weekend security has been provided. The carpet and hallways are in bad condition and smell horrible. My floor always smells like meth, curry, and trash. The only response from management is that they are not responsible for anything, and the lease mentions this a million times. Dog owners Dog owners are not responsible. I have had my neighbor\u0026apos;s dog pee and poop in front of my door several times. There is dog poop scattered all around the premises, sidewalks, and the park at the end of the property. This mostly comes from big dogs so it is a very foul smelling and accumulates quickly. The doggy bags the property has provided are large sized trash bags which the homeless use and discard along the nearby nature trail. There are pit bulls on premises. The owner breeds them and told me in a conversation that they are aggressive. I have caught him two times with his dogs off the leash inside and outside the building. Delivery/Parking/Trash Valet My first three weeks here I had 4 packages stolen or that went missing. The other reviews about this subject are correct. The response from management is that they are working on the situation. Again, no progress seen. The parking garage is extremely trashy and dirty with all sorts of residues that get trafficked into the building. There are abandoned cars and then there are those residents who do not respect parking regulations. There are residents who park in front of the building all the time and never get towed as management has proclaimed it would happen. Trash Valet does not collect on the weekends and the hours they do collect vary widely each day. Some residents always leave their garbage cans outside in the corridor which is against lease terms. Other I have never received a walkthrough checklist. Management has no record of vehicles of residents. There are storage closets which management wants to charge an exuberant extra fee for on top of overpriced rent. I am still waiting 5 weeks and several follow-ups for them to tell me which units are available. Management can\u0026apos;t even spell the name of the road correctly on their notices. There are also BBQ grills which are still visible even after a notice was sent to residents which is a direct violation of fire code. The streetlights on eon\u0026apos;s side have not worked for weeks. I do hope things get better, but this is the current situation here. Take heed and make informed decisions.","review_title_s":"Worst apartments I have ever lived in","reviewer_description_s":"Current Resident"},"text":""}],[{"booleans":{"is_recommended_b":false,"is_review_banished_b":false},"complexId":"888763732230324","complexName":"ibex at Uptown","dates":{"earliest_create_date_dt":{"date":21,"day":2,"hours":6,"minutes":36,"month":5,"seconds":23,"time":1655818583000,"timezoneOffset":420,"year":122}},"floats":{"rating_overall_most_recent_f":1.7,"response_rating_value_f":0,"rating_overall_f":1.7},"id":"REVIEW113190219","integers":{"rating_grounds_i":1,"num_reviews_user_complex_i":1,"rating_noiselevel_i":1,"rating_construction_i":1,"response_rating_count_i":0,"rating_maintenance_i":1,"rating_recommend_i":1,"end_year_i":2022,"rating_safety_i":1,"rating_neighborhood_i":5,"is_visible_i":1,"is_approved_i":1,"vote_count_i":0,"rating_officestaff_i":1,"begin_year_i":2021,"object_id_i":113190219},"longs":{"user_id_l":5058755},"multiInteger":null,"multiString":null,"objectCreateDate":{"date":21,"day":2,"hours":6,"minutes":36,"month":5,"seconds":23,"time":1655818583000,"timezoneOffset":420,"year":122},"objectId":"113190219","objectType":"REVIEW","objectUpdateDate":{"date":21,"day":2,"hours":6,"minutes":36,"month":5,"seconds":23,"time":1655818583000,"timezoneOffset":420,"year":122},"resourceUrl":"","strings":{"reviewer_type_s":"tenant","author_s":"anonymous","review_text_s":"The worst community in the area, the new management sucks, high turnovers can\u0026rsquo;t keep good staff, the concierge acts more as management trying to assist with prolonged issues with out the knowledge, while the management stands back overseeing and buying furniture instead of fixing real issues, says a lot about her priorities and experience.

However, these problems have been stemming since 2017, so clearly there is no real care to make this a desirable place for their residents. In addition, take a look in the elevators next time you\u0026apos;re visiting, and you\u0026apos;ll see the monetary incentive to write good reviews. I\u0026apos;ve been here since then, and have let my optimism get the better of me, particularly when announcements were made last year to change leadership. I think this was an attempt to shift blame, because it has actually gotten worse. The appeal of Marta and access to shops/ bars is a blinding attraction to this complex. One of the worst decisions I\u0026apos;ve made. This entire place is incompetent from the ground up. The valet garbage does not work, or they haven\u0026apos;t been paid by eon, yet residents are lining the hallways with garbage. Watch your step for glass throughout the garage, as there have been multiple car break-ins, in a \u0026quot;GATED\u0026quot; garage. Most days you don\u0026apos;t need your fob to get in, as the magnetic lock doesn\u0026apos;t work to get into the elevator lobby from the garage. In addition, while there are two elevators, only one has been in operation since late 2020, so I\u0026apos;d plan for an extra 10-15 minutes door-to-car. The water bill has avg over $250 since March of 2021, and eon has refused to deal with the problem. Their solution is transferring my calls until, hopefully, I tire out and give up. I\u0026apos;ve talked with the City of Atlanta, and they said it\u0026apos;s a complex issue, not a water pumping issue. The front office is a joke. There were two people on staff, one was entirely enthralled with her Facebook feed, while the other was resolving a dispute with her friends from the evening before. All clearly more pressing matters than those of the residents waiting patiently in the lobby to have their problems dealt with. Should you order a package, and wish to pick it up, you\u0026apos;d have to make time to queue up in a 2hr time slot, during the middle of the day, with all the other residents who\u0026apos;re also finally able to receive what they purchased. I\u0026apos;ve started sending all of my Amazon packages to the pick-up hub near GT, because at least there I am assured I can get my stuff during their business hours. I\u0026apos;m excited to move to another complex in Buckhead/ Lindbergh. The area is great, but not every place there is. I\u0026apos;ve terminated my lease early, fully knowing that the remainder would have to be paid out. No matter. Anything to get out of here.
